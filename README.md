# Asynchronous DOM Manipulation Bug in HTML

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in HTML: attempting to access and modify a DOM element before it's fully loaded.  This can occur in situations where JavaScript code executes earlier than the element's inclusion in the DOM tree.

## The Bug

The `bug.html` file illustrates this problem. The JavaScript code attempts to modify the `innerHTML` of the `div` with the ID `myDiv` before the browser has fully parsed and rendered the HTML. This leads to a `TypeError` or similar error, preventing the modification from happening.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the fix. The solution incorporates an event listener that waits for the entire HTML document to be fully parsed using the `DOMContentLoaded` event.  Only after this event fires does the JavaScript attempt to modify the `innerHTML`, ensuring the element exists.

This simple addition prevents the error and guarantees consistent behavior across different browsers and loading conditions.
