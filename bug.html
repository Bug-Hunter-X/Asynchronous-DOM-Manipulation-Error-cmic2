    This text will be replaced.

  <script>
    //Attempting to access an element that doesn't exist yet due to asynchronous loading.
    document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML = "This is the new text.";
    // The issue lies here.  The script runs *before* the element 'myDiv' is fully loaded into the DOM
